d(n) = sum of proper factors of n
An amicable pair of numbers are defined as:
  d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a ~= b

The Factorization class from problem 12 can be
used here to find the factors of a given number.

The factorization of each number can then be
summed and that number can be factorized and
summed to test for an amicable pair.
