A palindrome is a number that reads the same way backwards and forwards.
In order for a number to be a palindrome the first half of the number
must be a mirror image of the second half.
[abcd] [dbca] = abcddbca
[abc] d [cba] = abcdcba

Using this information a construction for a palindrome can be performed
instead of iterating through the entire range. This way only palindromes
will be check for divisibilty with the three digit numbers.

p = [abcddbca] or [abcdbca]
f = (|p| % 2 == 0) ? p[0..(|p|/2-1)] : p[0..(|p|/2-1)]
s = (|p| % 2 == 0) ? p[(|p|/2)..(|p|-1)] : p[(|p|/2)..(|p|-1)]
The next palindrome is (|p| % 2 == 0) ? [f-1] + [f-1].reverse : [f-1] + [f-1].reverse.shift

The construction takes in the number and splits it in half. The first half of the number
is decremented then reversed. The reversed half is concatenated with the first half in
order to get the next prime in the sequence. The palindrome could be found in the opposite
direction by simply changing the decrement to an increment.

This will encounter problems when the decrement or increment change will change the number
of digits in the number. In this case the number will have to switch to the other way
to split the number.

The largest three digit number is 999.
The smallest three digit number is 100.

The range on the possible palindromes is 100^2 to 999^2.

Once the next palindrome is found it will have to be checked against the range of numbers in
question which is all three digit numbers. The range can be reduced by observing that
998^2 cannot be divisible by 999. So only the numbers from 100 to sqrt(n) need to be checked
as a factor of the palindrome. If a three digit number has a pair that is also a three
digit number while iterating over the range the current palindrome is the largest such
number.
