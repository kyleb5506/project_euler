Fundamental Theorm of Arithmetic
x(0)^a(0) * x(1)^a(1) * ... * x(n)^a(n)
where
  X is the set of primes
  xi is in X
  ai is in the set of natural numbers
All numbers can be written as a product of prime numbers.

F is the set of factors for n.
F is a subset of the natural numbers.
There exist x,y that are in F such that x*y = n.
A set of two factors of n multipled together equal n.
When x = y :=> x^2 = n :=> x = sqrt(n) (only when n is a square).

A prime number is a number such that the only factors of the number
are one and itself.

Since the set of factors of a number mirror across the square root
of the number only the numbers from 2 to the square root of the number
must be checked in order to determine if a number is prime or
composite.

A prime sieve can be constructed using this idea to check the relevant
set of potential factors and determine primality. The sieve can then
hold the prime until the next prime is needed.

The prime factorization of a number can be determined by iterating
across the primes until the quotient of the number and the primes
of the factorization is equal to one.
