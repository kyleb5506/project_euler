A is a triangle of numbers such that the number of
elements per row is equal to the row number.
row 1: 1 element
row 2: 2 elements
row n: n elements

B is a construction from A tracking the maximum path
between the adjacent elements at every level.

Each element of B can be defined by the following relationship:

B[i, j] = max(B[i-1, j-1], B[i-1, j]) + A[i, j]

Each element of B is the maximum total that can be attained
from previous adjacent elements of A.

The solution is not brute force because not all paths are
calculated. Only the paths that could potentially be the
largest are kept.

The complexity of this approach is linear because all
elements of A must be traversed in order to arrive at the
solution in every case.
