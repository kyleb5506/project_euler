A composite number is a positive integer which can be divided by
a number that is not one or itself.
c = x * y where x > 1 and y > 1 and y > x
If x and y are both prime numbers the product is the prime
factorization of c.
For any number to be a factor of a composite number the prime
factorization of that number must appear within the prime
factorization of the composite number.
C = Set of prime factors of c (with multiples)
X = Set of prime factors of x (with multiples)
if X is a subset of C then x is a factor of c
Therefore in order for a number to be a multiple of all numbers
within a specified range it must contain as a subset the set of
each numbers' prime factors within its own set of prime
factors.
